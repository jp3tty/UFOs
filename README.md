# UFOs

## Overview
A dynamic website was built to filter through a database of UFO sighting information. Under the title, a body of text desribes the intent of the website and a number input elements, on the left, provide the user with the means to search through the data. The table of sighting data is loaded to the right of search elements. Specific information can be input to provide sighting dates, locations, and shapes. 


## Results
Loading the intial site will load a page that looks like the following:

)

The data in the table can be sorted through 5 input fields:

The table updates when a value is entered into any of the inputs. The filtered information replaces the data table with the updated information.

Below are examples of a the site filtering for a city, a state and a city with shape.

![CityExample](https://github.com/jp3tty/UFOs/blob/main/Images/CityExample.PNG)
5 elements return for an "el cajon" city search.

![StateExample](https://github.com/jp3tty/UFOs/blob/main/Images/StateExample.PNG)
3 elements return for a "ky" state search.

![CityAndShape](https://github.com/jp3tty/UFOs/blob/main/Images/CityAndShape.PNG)
1 elements returns for an "ar" and "disk" search.


## Summary
This website is a good starting point for gathering UFO sighting information but it has plently of room to grow. At the moment one major drawback to this webpage is the relatively small amount of data it contains. Scraping other UFO sight websites could help build up a larger data table for this site to make it more compelling.

The site could also use a revision on its search inputs. Changing the filter entries upper and lower case sensitivity would make the site more user-friendly.
